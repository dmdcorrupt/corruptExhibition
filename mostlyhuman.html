                    The art piece, a figment of the imagination, dark and sinister.

                <p>
                    An art piece looking to the future of cybernetics and trans-humanism. The effects of bodies adapted with biomechanical parts inclusive of AI interfaces accelerating at light speed.
                    Almost Human expresses this problem showing how reproductive systems could work if machines or body controlling parts oversaw human behaviour for reproduction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Babies could be created within a host, but information transferred not by placenta and an umbilical cord but over data wires carrying information to the cyborg foetus.
                    I chose this subject as this is a current ignored problem of cybernetics and human adaption. Especially with inclusion of artificial intelligence.
                    The idea for this project was simply from my brain in a flash thought where many of my ideas come from. Something I do think about being part Cyborg myself… See cyborg means human with foreign parts i.e., cybernetics. This can range from prosthetics and pacemakers to hearing aids. It’s adapted parts of the body with machinery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cybernetics is an approach to how humans, animals and machines can control and communicate with each other so humans at this point in life can choose to transcend the selves. I say themselves as there is no gender applicable to cyborgs.
                    The above statement on gender may contradict my project but this is not the case as I have not defined a specific gender! If you thought it was a female because “it” is carrying a child that could be ignorance to the future of AI. AI could build vessels using the same tools used in human reproduction but not gender specific like humans are.
                    I guess it could to some be a confusing subject that could well shock future humans. It could all come from nowhere, stunning the population, minus the believers of the day “dooms day”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everybody knows transhumanism from movies and video games but who knows about the real-life applications?
                    Will my project disrupt human thoughts? I do hope so, but it could need people to open up, think out of the box or even maybe research the subject.
