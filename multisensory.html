                    BorisBot is an interactive chatbot that aims to challenge the political compass of individual users. 
                    Recent advancements in editing technology have seen an uprising of video formats titled Deepfakes.  
                    These can be in the form of a video where an individual’s face is computer generated over another individual or in the form of audio where an individuals voice is synthesised and ran with a script to make that person appear to say obscure things. 
                    BorisBot uses the voice of our Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, in a way that attempts to replicate real human interaction whilst also ridiculing him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The intention of this project is to see if such a chatbot could manipulate a user’s opinion on a person or party. 
                    This disruption in politics on a much larger scale could have the ability to swing votes and even swing election results. 
                    A key element of BorisBot is satire and stupidity. 
                    Politicians are notorious for saying things that are questionable at the least and Boris Johnson is no exception to this. 
                    BorisBot aims to take this to another level with responses that include threats to the NHS and subtle compliments to the Conservatives opposition, Labour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BorisBot was created using the p5.js libraries to allow for audio-visual capabilities without overcomplicating the coding process. 
                    Boris’ responses are spliced together using speeches the PM has made during the current COVID-19 global pandemic. 
                    In terms of stylisation BorisBot is designed to look like a text message chain. 
                    This is mainly due to the current social distancing measures that are in place. 
                    Unable to communicate face to face, many individuals have confided in texting in order to keep in contact with friends and family. 
                    Therefore, the idea of BorisBot is to replicate these interactions but with the Prime Minister as opposed to someone the users knows themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BorisBot works in a simpler way to speech synthesis but still holds the same core values. 
                    Rather than the bot being trained to respond appropriately, it has been hard coded with responses for a large variety of conversation topics. 
                    Visually, BorisBot makes it pretty obvious that these interactions are potentially being manipulated but it still aims to show the potential impacts of these sorts of projects and also raise awareness of their existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project has definitely advanced my JavaScript ability in terms of string queries and interacting with user inputs. 
                    It has also allowed me to experiment with transcribing videos with timestamps to make searching for content easier. 
                    Whilst working on BorisBot I realised very quickly how manipulative an application like this could be. 
                    After a while I started to forget which clips had been edited and which were natural. 
                    As someone who is accustomed to audio manipulation this did not worry me too much, but I was concerned about older demographics using BorisBot. 
                    Therefore, I felt that I had achieved my original goal of potentially swinging a vote or opinion on a political party or party member.
