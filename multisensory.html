                    My work surrounds synesthesia, a neurological condition in which one sensory input is perceived as if it is one or more additional senses, such as sound, or touch. I have developed a project based on Chromesthesia – where sound is processed as colour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The piece begins in the minds of many people, some strangers – who were asked to pick a piece of music which held great value to them, a song they would listen to if it was the “End of the World”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They were each asked to play this song, while painting an image which expressed their thoughts, feelings and interpretations surrounding the sounds as well as the emotions they evoked. Their only instructions - It must be a circle; and it is recommended that paint is used (Digital or analogue) as a medium. There were no constraints to time. These images were then posted or scanned to me, along with their chosen song. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Circles were used so that the person could, if they wished, fill the shape as the song progressed in the same way as a record or CD, but also to omit edges (Or the need to fill them) and symbolize the ever continuation of sound, looping and changing. Paint was recommended as a fluid and expressive medium, but not limited to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To present digital synesthesia, data from their chosen song was used to create a version of the image. Using the values generated by Spotify’s music API for each song, the images have then been digitally manipulated to reflect an interpretation of data  - for example, the pitch of the sound affects the edge width of the outlines of work. In this way, visual interpretations are formed by data, sound is turned into visual graphics. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using a manual creative process, I then overlay the 2 images to create a final rendition which is placed in a grid like fashion – anonymously, as part of an ever changing set of media and human based multi-sensory interaction. The images are placed in a grid like arrangement, to represent each person they came from within their own space, side by side. The artistic process and human touch is what I enjoy most about this work - with the current circumstances, communication with others ever so important. To this end, the piece has involved discussion, communication and feedback with those involved continually and throughout. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My aim was to combine the power and diversity of human expression with a digital overlay combining the thoughts of the person with the song itself – when collectively displayed, this presents a visual impression of a group’s most important and personal thoughts. Perhaps the current state of the world has impacted these creations, and perhaps in time, they will change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To complement this work, I have created a Spotify playlist made from the songs picked by individuals involved. Listen to the “End of the World” Playlist here:

                </a>
                <p>
                    Contributions are still welcome and will be added to the piece weekly. Email your circle to: summer.ashbury@students.plymouth.ac.uk
