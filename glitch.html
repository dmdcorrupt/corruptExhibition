                    My work for this course allowed me the opportunity to use my chosen theme of glitch art to reflect current events and it has affected my everyday life. Following this theme, I decided to name my work ‘Setback’ which relates to how glitches delay a person from completing their tasks, just as how the current pandemic has delayed everyone from living their lives the way we post lockdown.  
                    Since my theme was glitch art, that meant that I could explore multiple different ways of applying it to my designs. I chose specific images for the basis of each of my designs because I believed that they could all represent something that relates to how life has changed since being placed in in lockdown and that everyday feels repetitive.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    The meaning behind the image for my first design was that it was taken when myself and others could go outside and see sights like that easily. However, the effect that I added was that I used my phone to take a picture of the image on my computer screen, then emailing myself that image and repeating the process several times.  
                    This process was meant to use the sunset to show that every day comes to an end, the only difference is that each day in these current events feels the same as the previous one.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since using this method of repetition for my first design was so effective, I decided to apply the same method to my other designs, while making sure that each of them was unique and different than the others.  
                    I think one of my most effective designs is my ‘Door Glitch’ design, which was made by taking a picture of the front door in my house from the inside at each next hour. This was meant to show that, as for the present time, none of us can open our own doors and walk out of them as easily as we used to, or as eagerly as we want to.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The glitch element for this design is shown because it is the same image in the same place each time, as if it is a video that is frozen on a one scene, but the audio continues on, which shows that the video is still playing.  
                    I believe that I was able to use ‘glitch art’ to show how everyday life has changed as a result of current events, and that each design shows this message in its own way. As a result of exploring all these different approaches to applying a ‘glitch’ effect to my work, it has shown me that taking different approaches to making a design can still create something that sends the same message.
