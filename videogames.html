                    Are Video Games Art? That is the real question here with this exhibit. It’s a heavily debated and discussed topic amongst many. It still even now doesn’t have a definite statement deciding on whether they are classed as art even though the U.S supreme court states that games are art and therefore deserve the same protections as others which are classed as art too. Video Games include a collision of different types of art in every game that’s made. Due using the use of traditional artistic expressions, sculpture work in the form of 3D modelling, illustration, narrative arcs, and including dynamic music throughout. It’s believed to become the most important medium of art in the future due to this.

                    The aim of my animation is to try convince people that video games are art or at least have them leaning more towards believing the statement at least. I decided to create an animation in order to get my point across and I was certain on this from the off. I felt there’s a lot that can be done within an animation and especially with how I wanted to portray it. I decided to play on the ‘game’ style setting and aesthetic due to the fact that my animation is to get a point across related to video games, so I felt it was best to have it feel like a game throughout. It’s also quite ironic that I gave it a video game style especially when I’m trying to get across that video games actually are art. I decided to work with Dragon Ball Z and the use of its characters due to the fact it’s such an iconic series and many know of it and this could also help bringing people in to watch it due to that vested interest. Also, my focus was a debate throughout the animation, so what better two characters to use than Goku and Vegeta who at first started out as enemies until they became friends and my work plays on this with the fact at the start of it they disagree on the point but come the end they end up agreeing with each other and stop fighting.

                    As someone who has a fond interest within animation, I feel that by creating this piece of work it has benefited me greatly and I hope to in the future create more animations which play on aspects of the real world. By exploring the inner workings of two characters and a narrative already created like in Dragon Ball Z and work that into how I chose to go about my own narrative was challenging. Not only that, but the fact I tried incorporating some of their own lines and personalities within this piece of work itself really had me thinking as I had to use them when necessary not just chuck them in anywhere.
